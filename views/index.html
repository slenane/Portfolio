                        Designed and developed personalised e-commerce site based on client's vision and halved their monthly website fees.
                        Shopify was integrated to handle secure payments, product inventory and to provide the client with full control of the business.  
                    </p>

                            <h4>Description</h4>
                            <p>
                                Client had created a site with a drag-and-drop website provider that achieved a high volume of visitors but a low conversion rate.
                                The site required a personal design and identity that matched the product but the limited available options made the site look outdated and as a result customers did not find it trustworthy.
                                I designed and developed the site based on the clients ideas and integrated a Shopify Lite, giving their site an identity and a reduction in monthly subscription fees.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h4>Difficulties</h4>
                            <p>
                               The client's original site lacked structure and a natural flow that would make navigation easier for users and lead to increased sales.
                               The client needed the freedom to add and edit products, add discounts and control shipping fees. 
                               They also required a blog and a partner site information page they cold update freely.
                               Most importantly, the client was looking for a cheaper alternative to the service they were using as the subscription fees continued to rise and there was a product limit.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="project_solutions">
                            <h4>Solutions</h4>
                            <p>
                                The site was completely redesigned from scratch, creating a more cohesive and consistent structure while maintaining the personal feel of the original site.
                                It was designed to highlight the key areas client wanted more traffic and provide a flow that makes navigation easier for the users.
                                By integrating a Shopify Lite store, I was able to give the client full control of the business with no product limit. 
                                Any changes made on Shopify would dynamically update the information on their new site.
                                By hosting the site on Heroku, I was able to provide a secure service with SSL certification to make it trustworthy.
                                Using the above services led to the client's monthly fees being reduced to less than half of what they had been paying for their previous site.

                                Most chess experts claim that solving chess puzzles is the most effective chess training method to improve your chess skills.
                                So I wanted to develop a free chrome extension that would allow the user to improve their chess conveniently from the browser.

                                Most chess application require a paid membership to have unlimited access to puzzles. So I needed to find a way to import the puzzle information for free.
                                Puzzle data is in PGN format so this information would then need to be parsed and divided into individual moves.
                                All potential moves needed to be incorporated, for example, castling on both sides and pawn promotion.
                                It also needed to look familiar and function similarly to the major chess sites so users would be comfortable using it immediately.
                            </p>

                                chess.com's chess-web-api provided the information for their daily puzzle in PGN notation.
                                This information was parsed and separated into individual moves with a regular expression. 
                                chessboard.js was used to generate the chessboard with moveable pieces and chess.js was used for the chess logic and rules.
                                With chess.js, you can view the current position in PGN notation. 
                                Using these three packages I was able to set the starting position and allow the user to make a move, the PGN of which was then compared to the expected value.
                                If the move matched, the puzzle continued. If not, the user is shown an incorrect move message and asked to try again.  
                                The style and controls were made to match chess.com for familiarity.
                                The chess-web-api also releases the notation for a random daily puzzle from the archives, which updates every 15 seconds allowing unlimited free access to past puzzles.

                            Updates on your progress is essential to keeping you motivated to achieve your goals.
                            The application allows you to track and view your progress in real time, regardless of the type of goal.
                            Goals are divided into categories to maintain focus on all goals.

                            Not all goals can be measured in the same way.
                            If you would like to quit or achieve something, they need to be tracked in different ways.
                            Some goals can be marked with a checkbox, while others may need to be shown with a target value.
                            With target values, users need to be able to write notes to reflect on how they have progressed.

                            Users add sub-goals to the goal categories which make up the percentage complete value.
                            Checked and target sub-goals are weighted evenly, with the percentage completion of the targets being immediately added to the goal percentage.
                            This allows for a more accurate representation of user progress. 
                            For example, if you plan to run 1,000km in a year, the percentage completion will be updated with each entry and not only when the target is reached. 
                            Notes can be added to the targets to keep track of your progress.
                            Goals can be organised as the user sees fit and sub-goals are moved to the bottom upon completion to shift focus to the next goal.

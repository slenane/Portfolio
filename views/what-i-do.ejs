                  A responsive design makes your website accessible to all users, regardless of their device.

                  Search engine optimization is the process of improving your site to increase its visibility when people search for products or services related to your business in Google, Bing, and other search engines. 
                  By focusing on performance, accessibility and best practices I can make your website fast, easy to find, and reach the widest audience possible.
                  Google Analytics will provide insights into performance and user interaction to better understand your customers and how they use your site.

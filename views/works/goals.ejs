          Not all goals can be measured in the same way. If you would like to
          quit or achieve something, they need to be tracked in different ways.
          Some goals can be marked with a checkbox, while others may need to be
          shown with a target value. With target values, users need to be able
          to write notes to reflect on how they have progressed.

          Users add sub-goals to the goal categories which make up the
          percentage complete value. Checked and target sub-goals are weighted
          evenly, with the percentage completion of the targets being
          immediately added to the goal percentage. This allows for a more
          accurate representation of user progress. For example, if you plan to
          run 1,000km in a year, the percentage completion will be updated with
          each entry and not only when the target is reached. Notes can be added
          to the targets to keep track of your progress. Goals can be organised
          as the user sees fit and sub-goals are moved to the bottom upon
          completion to shift focus to the next goal.

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          Most chess experts claim that solving chess puzzles is the most
          effective chess training method to improve your chess skills. So I
          wanted to develop a free chrome extension that would allow the user to
          improve their chess conveniently from the browser.

        <h4>Difficulties</h4>
        <p>
          Most chess application require a paid membership to have unlimited
          access to puzzles. So I needed to find a way to import the puzzle data
          for free. Puzzle data is in PGN format so this data would then need to
          be parsed and divided into individual moves. All potential moves
          needed to be incorporated, for example, castling on both sides and
          pawn promotion. It also needed to look familiar and function similarly
          to the major chess sites so users would be comfortable using it
          immediately.

        <h4>Solutions</h4>
        <p>
          chess.com's chess-web-api provided the data for their daily puzzle in
          PGN notation. This data was parsed and separated into individual moves
          with regular expressions. chessboard.js was used to generate the
          chessboard with moveable pieces and chess.js was used for the chess
          logic and rules. With chess.js, you can view the current position in
          PGN notation. Using these three packages I was able to set the
          starting position and allow the user to make a move, the PGN of which
          was then compared to the expected value. If the move matched, the
          puzzle continued. If not, the user is shown an incorrect move message
          and asked to try again. The style and controls were made to match
          chess.com for familiarity. The chess-web-api also releases the
          notation for a random daily puzzle from the archives, which updates
          every 15 seconds allowing unlimited free access to past puzzles.
